Memory hierarchy for libiscsi.

At the top level we have a talloc context. For now we use struct iscsi_context
which is a top level talloc object.
iscsi_context contains TALLOC_CTX *scsi_tasks which is a talloc context which is the parent context for all scsi_task structures.


The most important objects are 'struct scsi_task'. These are always created as children to iscsi->scsi_tasks
Any data that is associated with the scsi-task, for example data-in buffers and 
structured from unmarshalling are all childred of the scsi_task talloc object
they belong to.


ISCSI-PDUs except for ISCSI-COMMAND
These are all created as child objects to the top level talloc context (struct iscsi_context)

ISCSI-COMMAND PDUs
These are all created as childred of the scsi_task talloc object that they
refer to.
